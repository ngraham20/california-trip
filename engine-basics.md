## Turn Phases
In the **Observation Engine**, players take their turn in any order desired, since everything that happens during a single round does so roughly simultaneously. Players may choose whether to complete an action or actions within this time, as long as they feel there is enough time to do so.

### Example 1:

**Oberon** and **Tia** are both hiding behind a barrel, and they notice that a **Goblin Footsoldier** is walking their way. They know that when the goblin reaches them, they will be noticed. They estimate that the goblin will reach them in 20 seconds.

The two players now have about 20 seconds of game time to account for. This is not enforced by a real life timer, but the **GM** may require that the players don't over-strategize or take too much time to figure out what to do. In cases like these, the **GM** may require the **Group Leader** or any single group member to decide without consulting the rest of the group. This creates a sense of tention that would be felt by a group in this situation.

### Example 2:
**Elenor** stops dead in her tracks, aiming her assult rifle at the enormous, red dragon. She puts her eye to her scope and lifts the barrel of her weapon high, the dragon's scales rushing across her view. Without warning, the red turned to bright orange, and **Elenor** froze, and her blood turned cold. She had forgotten to make sure that the dragon was distracted, and she stood alone, in the middle of the room, with the dragon glaring down at her from above.

Here, **Elenor** has clearly made a big mistake. The dragon is fully aware of her presence. Since the dragon and the player are more or less taking their turn simultaneously, if **Elenor** chooses to fire at the dragon, it will immediately strike her down. Her only hope of survival now is to run, hide, and hope that her friends had made better decisions.

## Attribute Tests

Unlike many other popular tabletop RPGs, this engine does not rely on dice or chance in order to resolve skill tests. Instead, passive skill levels and creativity are used to conquer enemies and pass other skill tests. This makes skill tests themselves simpler to keep track of, but can make encounters a guaranteed success in some situations, while actually impossible in others. It's up to the players to understand which situations are which.

## Speed, Agility, and Strength
These three attributes dictate the physical attributes of a character and are dictated by a level number between 1 and 20.

- **Speed** indicates how fast a character can move. This affects both movement speed and attack speed.
- **Agility** indicates how quickly and easily a character can change positions and how flexible they are.
- **Strength** indicates raw physical strength, affecting the weapons that a character can use, how hard they hit, and how high they can jump.

## Charisma, Wisdom, and Intelligence
These three attributes are not represented on the **character sheet**, and are instead keywords that describe which attribute is important for passing certain **skill tests**.

### Example
**Elgrim** has been caught on camera after hours at a bank, the player, acting as the character, must attempt to give a good explaination to the security guard (the **GM**) as to why he was there. **Charisma** and **Intelligence** are important attributes here. **Elgrim** might know that the guard is new here and might not know if a new employee has been hired or not, so he decides to lie through his teeth. This would be an **intelligence** check. If **Elgrim** instead attempts to flirt with the guard and comment on how he must work out a lot, that would be a **charisma** check. In both of these cases, the **GM** simply rates how convincing the player was against the respective stats of the guard. Of course, a more convincing lie or a more believable flirt will score higher.

---
**Note:** The goal here is not necessarily to be a good actor, though that can certainly help. It is up to the **GM** to decide whether acting skills will or will not affect the test result based on what they know about the player. It is not recommended to require new or shy players to act boldly, instead rating the interaction off the words said.

## Investigation, Observation, and Opportunity
The mechanics of these last three attributes are less straightforward than the previous six. The basic idea here is that the more that a player understands about a given character, the better equiped they are to handle a situation involving them. For example, knowing that an **NPC** has recenly lost a loved one may mean they're more likely to sympathize with someone in a similar situation, which is an **emotional weakness** that may be exploited. Or, knowing a certain enemy's weak spot may help sway a fight. Types of knowledge a character might have include **personality**, **mood**, **strengths**, and **weaknesses**.

- **Investigation** is a character's pre-existing knowledge about another **character**, **NPC** or **enemy**. There is no number associated with this attribute. Instead, the player must gain knowledge and write it down themselves. If and **NPC** tells them that the dragon that storms their village from time to time has a missing scale at the base of her neck, then that player can assume to land a guaranteed critical attack if they can land a hit there.

- **Observation** is a character's ability to notice details about another **character**, **NPC**, or **enemy**, or even discover various other opportunities. There is a number associated with this attribute, which determines how detailed a character's observation is. A **1** means that the character notices only the obvioius, but a **20** would be the observation skills of **Sherlock Holmes**. The player must intentionally ask questions about the room they're in and the objects they can see. However, just because a player notices a that there's a strange runic language on a vase does not mean that they can read it or understand its significance. Therefore, **Observation** must be used in combination with other gained information to understand the environment.

- **Opportunity** is a character's ability to take advantage of known weaknesses, as well as the opportunity of a surprise. When this opportunity is taken, the encounter can be heavily weighted in favor of the opportunist.

## Skills and Skill Aquisition
**Skills** are active abilities that players can aquire throughout a campaign. Depending on the world that the **GM** has chosen for their players, these skills can range anywhere from the use of **throwing knives** to the ability to **hack** into basic security systems. These skills do not involve chance, but can factor in levels of difficulty.

### Example
**Jason** has the skills required to break into EVM-3, EVM-4, and EVM-5 security systems. When his group is attempting to break into a large corporation to steal information for their client, he notices that the security system they use is an EVM-6. Had this system been an EVM-4, Jason could have broken in without any trouble. However, since this system is part of the EVM Series, he guesses that the manufacturer might not have changed too much since the EVM-5, and he attempts to hack into it anyway. In this example, let's say the **GM** deciedes that the EVM-6 is similar to the EVM-5, but different enough that it takes twice as long to hack into is than expected. Depending on how tight the timeline is for this heist, that may or may not matter.

**Skill Aquisition** can happen in many different ways, and generally, this is up to the **GM**. However, suggested manners of aquiring skills are learning them from either **NPCs** or **Books**. An **NPC** may choose to teach a character a new skill in exchange for **money**, **favors**, or **items**. They may even do this for free if they're feeling generous. A player may also find **Books** or **Tomes** lying around the world, which contain instructions on using a new skill. Additionally, the **GM** may choose to allow certain skills to become more potent with use or even through finding **Books** and **NPCs** that will increase the potency of a given skill.
