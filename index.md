The only chances involved are the ones you take yourself.

# So, Why Design a New Engine?

It's extremely evident that tabletop RPGs are a popular passtime, not only among teenagers and college students, but among adults as well. I played my first game of **Dungeons & Dragons** when I was at college, and while I enjoyed playing, there was something about it that kept pushing my interests away from playing again. Was it how long it kept taking? Not really, there are a lot of things I do that take a long time. Was it the playstyle or class I picked? No, and actually, I enjoyed playing a fallen angle-born paladin with a demon unicorn mount. I landed light, fire, and necrotic damige in a single hit, which felt awesome. So what caused me to not enjoy playing as much as the others did?

Since then, I've played two versions of a game called **Arkham Horror**. One of the games by this name is a board game: **Arkham Horror 3e**, where the skill checks are done with several **D6**s, much like **Shadorrun**. I often found myself frustrated with just how much chance was involved in each and every action I took, and no matter how many dice I rolled, it was always technically possible to fail, though improbable. The card game however, **Arkham Horror, the LCG**, in this game, the randomness is generated through the cards you draw into your hand at the end of the turn, but during the turn itself, there are ways to entirely remove chance from an encounter, causing an event to rely entirely on the stats of the character and the stragety between players.

I found that the later way of playing this game, which allowed me to make decisions based on the knowledge I had instead of dice rolls and statistics was a way I enjoyed more. There was always a chance I could make the wrong decision, since I didn't always have enough information to over strategize, but that chance was one that I took myself, not one the game forced on me with a dice roll. This idea is at the core of this tabletop rpg engine, and hopefully will allow for fun adventures for a diceless game.
