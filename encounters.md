# Encounters

There are three basic types of encounters: **Combat**, **Social**, and **Enviornmental** encounters.

## Combat Encounters
Combat Encounters occur any time that a player enters combat. This can occur when encountering an enemy, or when the party decides to kill the bartender for giving them a high bill. 

**Combat Encounters** are quick and dangerous. It is often necessary to understand the enemy before entering combat, or the players may find that their attacks don't do any damage. Instead of several rounds of rolling dice, calculating hit chances, then rolling for damage, players and enemies perform actions reactively. When a player swings a sword at an enemy, if the enemy is prepared for the attack, it might **block** or **dodge**. These are both dependent on the **strength** and **speed** attributes of the attacking and defending characters.

`if Attacker net Strength >= Defender net Strength, then block is successful`

`if Attacker net Speed < Defender net Speed, then the dodge is successful`

**Note:** In combat, the tie always goes to the attacker.

### Combat Example

**Elowyn** has a base strength of **10**, and she swings a **light rapier**, which has a weight of **2**. This means that her attack has a net strength of **8**. The Human Barbarian she's swinging at has a base strength of **12**, and the shield has a weight of **4**, so he also has a net strength of **8**. Ties go to the attacker, so Elowyn bashes the shield out of the way **stunning** the Human Barbarian. This gives Elowyn the chance to attack again, without worrying about being blocked. However, she must still target weak points in any armor that the Human Barbarian might be wearing.

## Social Encounters

A **Social Encounter** occurs any time a player interacts with an **NPC**. When a player is interacting with an NPC, the player's **social attributes** are being constantly evaluated. If a player speaks too harshly to a shy NPC, they may be unwilling to talk to that player. However, if a player speaks too weakly to an NPC who expects a certain level of self-respect, they may decide that that player isn't worth their time.
